  <title>Blazing fast queries with DuckDB integration</title>
  <p>
    In Datalore, you can use SQL to query DataFrames and CSV files
    thanks to the built-in integration with DuckDB â€” a powerful database system designed for analytical workloads.
    It allows you to seamlessly combine data sources, transform and clean datasets,
    perform aggregations on millions of rows, and then use the query results for further processing with Python or R.

  <chapter title="Incredible speed" id="incredible-speed">
    <p>
      DuckDB supports analytical query workloads and operates in memory,
      allowing it to handle joins, aggregations, and filters much faster
      than traditional databases or data processing tools, especially on large datasets.

    <p>
      DuckDB can access files directly without loading data into memory first.
      You can run SQL queries directly on DataFrames or large CSV, Parquet,
      or JSON files without importing or copying any data.
      It provides you with instant insights from datasets of multiple gigabytes.
